            Team Smart State is responsible for developing a product to support
            the United States Coast Guard communications system, called Rescue 21. This incredibly
            valuable system suppports communication for marine search and rescue
            missions. Currently, the issue with the Rescue 21 is that system failures must
            be classified manually by system engineers. Classifying system
            failures includes review of ticket reports currently generated by the 
            system. These tickets provide context regarding the type of error and 
            the hardware that was affected. Manual review of tickets pertaining system failures 
            is inefficient and prevents quick response to system or hardware outages.

            EMELIA is the solution that is meant to help system engineers respond
            to system failures. EMELIA stands for Event-driven MachinE Learning,
            Intelligent Assessor. Our project is meant to be a machine learning solution
            that will learn to classify system failures, utilizing a large set
            of training examples. Ultimately, the project aims to develop and explore the
            efficacy of a machine-learning tools that utilizes AI technologies to
            correctly analyze these failures, thereby reducing the need the time
            needed to manually look at every failure case.
