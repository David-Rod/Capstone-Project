        <h3>Overall Problem</h3>
        <p class="proj-desc">
            The United States Coast Guard Rescue 21 communications sytem
            relies on speed and efficiency to save lives. This state of the art
            technology is incredibly dependable, however issues can arise within
            this complex communications network. The current system uses a ticket
            system to generate reports regarding system failures. System Engineers
            parse through these tickets manually to classify system failures.These issues
            may be systems related or occur due to hardware failures. Determining
            the location and frequency of these errors can be a slow and tedious
            process for system engineers.

            The initial concept for this project was provided by our sponsor,
            in the form of a <a href="assets/Abousleman_GD-Emelia.pdf" target="_blank">
                Capstone project proposal</a>.

        <h3>General Solution</h3>
        <p class="proj-desc">
            EMELIA is the solution that will help system engineers respond
            to system failures. EMELIA stands for Event-driven MachinE Learning,
            Intelligent Assessor. System engineers will interact with EMELIA
            through a command line interface. EMELIA will utilize a neural
            network machine-learning model to solve the issue of manually
            classifying system failure reports. By using previous system failure
            reports to train the classifier, EMELIA will be capable of accurately
            classifying future reports. This process will streamline maintenance
            for system engineers, and allow first responders to work more effectively.
